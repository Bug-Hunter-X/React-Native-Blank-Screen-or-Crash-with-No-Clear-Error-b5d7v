The solution involves carefully reviewing your package.json and potentially updating or removing conflicting libraries.  If possible, use the most up-to-date stable versions of all your libraries.  Here's how you might address this in your code:

1. **Update Libraries:** Ensure all your libraries are compatible. Check the documentation for each package to find compatible React Native versions.
```javascript
npm update
```
2. **Version Conflict Resolution:** If updating isn't possible, you might need to find an alternative library or a resolution to the version conflict.  This might involve temporarily removing libraries to isolate the issue. 
3. **Debugging Techniques:** Use React Native's debugging tools, such as the debugger and the console logs, to narrow down the problem area. 
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** In some cases, running `npm install` and rebuilding the project can resolve underlying issues.   
5. **Examine Stack Trace (If Any):**  If a minimal stack trace is present, it might point to the area that needs attention.  Examine this stack trace for clues about the conflicting libraries or components.
