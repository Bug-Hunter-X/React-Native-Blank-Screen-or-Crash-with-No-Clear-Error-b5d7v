# React Native Blank Screen or Crash with No Clear Error

This repository demonstrates a common React Native issue: a blank screen or unexpected crash without a readily apparent error message in the console. The problem stems from incompatibilities between different library versions. 

The `problematicCode.js` file showcases the problematic code using incompatible libraries.  `solutionCode.js` offers a solution by updating or replacing the libraries to ensure compatibility and resolving version conflicts.
